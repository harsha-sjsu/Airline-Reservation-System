# Airline-Reservation-System
The airline reservation system is an application developed to help customers in reserving a flight between airports of his/her choice. The user can select the source and the destination airports on a specific date and our application will show all the available routes between the two selected airports with different airlines and prices. The user can make reservation by choosing any one of the routes available. This application calculates fare for the flight depending on the distance between the two airports. The user can see his/her itinerary based on the reservation and a unique code generated at the time of booking.
